# Developing a Seed Segmentation and Feature Extraction Algorithm Which Incorporates a Deep-Learning Architecture. 
[MComp Final Year Project]

The following project reviews the development of an image segmentation algorithm using deep learning strategies and its possible application within the field of botany image processing. Ultimately, 
this project followed the development of a superpixel convolutional neural network image segmentation 
algorithm, an algorithm which theoretically should combine the benefits of both techniques. This 
algorithm was applied to a series of different samples of seed image data, whereby the algorithm 
performance was assessed based upon the estimated confusion matrix and subsequent classification 
accuracy from a test dataset of images. Therefore, it is hoped that this project will provide botanists 
with means toward effective seed object extraction within seed samples, such that this useful data can 
be used by various botanists for further photometric analysis. In conclusion, the results of this project 
demonstrated clear capability toward accurate segmentation of the seed objects with the convolutional 
neural network classifying the seed and background superpixels with a 95.84% classification accuracy, 
which in turn allowed accurate segmentation to be procured on the seed sample images. However, the 
output segmentation accuracy was estimated to be an underwhelming 73.18%, therefore further work 
on model refinement and post-processing are evident.
