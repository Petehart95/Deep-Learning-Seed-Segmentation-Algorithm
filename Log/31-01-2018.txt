Despite my efforts throughout this project so far, progress on developing the CNN model has been slow due to lack of experience in this field.
Complications with the code has made it difficult to debug issues incurred from tensorflow and keras.
Therefore, a log is now being compiled on a daily basis to ensure that sufficient progress can be noted and learned from on a daily basis.
Fortunately, contingency time was built into the project plan, so there is time for the project to catch-up to a more desirable phase.

- Restarting pre-trained CNN model.
- Now attempting to build a pre-trained CNN model using the ImageNet database for the model weights.
- Initially using a flower-based dataset, but hoping to use a seed dataset later.
- Issues with the keras package: unable to access a layer. Will debug tomorrow.

Plan for tomorrow:
- Establish a working version with the flower dataset
- Resolve seed dataset
- Begin preparations for using the pre-trained model on the seed dataset.
