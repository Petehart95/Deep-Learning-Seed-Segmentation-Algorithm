Progress has finally been made today. Despite being considerably behind schedule now with the project, progress can finally be observed.
Essentially, I have abandoned the thought of using pre-trained models such as Inceptionv3, as I was constantly running into syntax issues with the model.
Therefore, I am currently experimenting with VGG-16 and VGG-19, which brought immediate results. Through research, I gather that these models are
estimated to be inferior in comparison to inceptionv3, but due to time constraints I believe it is wiser to have a working implementation of one of these
pre-trained models than nothing at all.

Effectively today, I have managed to get the models to load and attempt to predict the classification of the seeds using only the imagenet database.
While it is completely useless currently, I feel as though something can be made from this finally. Tomorrow, I aim to research more into inserting 
a custom dataset for the model to be trained on, and observe the results. Weightings, features and labels will be evaluated.
